# Project
#suicide rate prediciton:
This is a project that is based on suicide rate data from Kaggle. It includes data processing, model selection, parameter tuning, piplines.
Used models: Numpy, Pandas, Scikitlearn, Xgboost, Pyplot.
Used algorithms: SVM, random gredient descent, PCA, random forest, Adaboost, Xgboost, soft voting.
#spacy nlp:
a small showcase of my nlp/spacy skills, the size of the deep learning model is limited due to the limliting computational resources of my labtop.
#TagTrendPredicitor
A project that begins with a practical use in mind, to predict the popularity of the Ins tags. I have came to the conclusion that what influences a tag's popularity is the top influencers. Therefore I used octoparse and datamined top ~150 fitness influencers, and studied the correlations between their posts and the tags' popularity. Frome there, I built a model that predicts the popularity of the Ins tags.
used models: Numpy, Pandas, Scikitlearn, Xgboost, Pyplot, octoparse.
